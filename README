# MovieHelper

Pulls all of the movies out of the Live TV section of an EmbyServer and provides filtering tools.

## Benefits
- More than 1 days worth of data compared to the Live TV -> Movies page in the normal Emby client
- Ignore non-HD when HD is available
- Really Ugly Interface
- Filter for time of day (future)
- Filter by channels (future)
- Filter by genre (future)

## Install

This is all static (from the server's perspective) content. I dump it into a folder that Nginx serves. You can use pretty much anything.
